55:  "use theatricality to foreground certain character types, expose structural paradoxes, and highlight modes of performance common to the cinematic tale of terror."

Seems to use fear, horror, terror, gore interchangeably in the introduction.

56:  "the horror films considered here the theatre is visualized in *concrete terms* as the instigator of cinematic revenge."

56:  "the theatre is portrayed as a space specifically conceived for the performance of mercilessly violent retribution."

56:  "cinematic horror does not only *result* from a theatrical experience, it also graphically *transpires on stage*, thus superimposing theatrical and filmic terror."

56:  "explicit references to the stage provide insight into depictions of *masculine* monstrosity."

56:  monstrous-paternal--"a type of horror in which the artifice of the symbolic order takes over the scene in the terrifying form of a domineering father figure, adopting the theatricality of aggressively phallic signifiers to affect the audience."

57:  "horror's aggressive urge to repress the very terror it generates."

57:  "the sadist a stage performer and his cruelty is essentially a *performance*."

58:  "Horror on stage (and on film) is clearly something quite different from 'real' horror, and Gogol [in *Mad Love*] is evidently aroused by only the former."

62:  "In these films [*Theatre of Death*, *The Incredible Torture Show*/*Bloodsucking Freaks*, *The Wizard of Gore*], the theatre becomes an arena for repulsive, mesmerizing, and sexually charged spectacles in which the male stage director performs excessively violent and gory attacks on female bodies."

65:  "This one of the central functions of theatricality in the horror film: cinema relies on theatre's disciplinarian artificiality to expose horror's dual purpose as an entertaining spectacle of fearsome excess and an unflinchingly repressive morality tale."

71:  *Theatre of Blood*'s "theatricality not only as a mode of display but as a principle of *doing*."
